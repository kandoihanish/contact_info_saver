# contact_info_saver
The webpage has a form that allows the user to input their first name, last name, and contact number.

When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the information is validated to ensure that all fields are filled out and the contact number is in the correct format. If the information is valid, it is added to a table on the webpage.

The table has columns for first name, last name, and contact number. The user can click on the column headers to sort the table by that column.

The table also has a search bar that allows the user to search for a specific name in the table.

The user can delete information from the table by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the corresponding row. Before the information is deleted, the user is prompted with an alert to confirm the deletion.

If the user tries to add duplicate information, they will receive an alert notifying them that the information already exists in the table.

The webpage also features data persistence, so that the information added to the table is stored in local storage and will still be there if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens their browser.
